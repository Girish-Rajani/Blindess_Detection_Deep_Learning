# Blindness_Detection_Deep_Learning


The goal of this project is to use algorithms in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, such as Convolutional Neural Networks to extract features from retina images to automate this process. This will be done by performing multi-class image classification using the APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection dataset. Machine learning models allow us to speed up the process of detecting DR early and make this service available to those who may not have access to the infrastructure.

Various models were made such as a custom CNN model, VGG-16 model, ResNet50 model, and an InceptionV3 model. After training and evaluating all models (with and without data augmentation), the test data was labelled using each model.
